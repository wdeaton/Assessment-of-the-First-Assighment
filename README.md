# Assessment-of-the-First-Assighment

Because this was the first assignment, I was nervous. I really want to do well in this class and I do feel like I really try. However, I do admit to being a bad writer. I tend to write how I speak and I know that is incorrect. It is a bad habit that I have been fighting my whole life and I feel like I have improved on it. I just always feel scared turning in writing assignments because of that reason. 

I did enjoy the writing assingment becuase I could relate to it. I knew my topic, I love my topic, and that made writing the assignment much easier! The new computer software we needed to know for the assignment was interesting too, so that helped as well. Having relatable material and new techniques help me stay focused and enjoy writing about my passion.

Lastly, the english departemnt does have a bad connotation due to past expereinces here. When many of us got here, the compositon classes difficulty was increased and about forty percent of my class did not pass it. So, in the back of my mind, even getting help, I was never going to be a good writer. Thats all I learned from those classes. 

That being said, I am excited to see how much progress i have had in my time here. I felt great about my paper, I felt like i tried hard, and really put some thought into this paper. I want to learn and get better.
